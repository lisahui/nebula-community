The underlying storage engine, overall architecture, different layers of Nebula all contribute to the performance issues. The goal of this project is to improve the OLTP and OLAT performance of Nebula by adjusting and optimizing the architecture and different layers. This may include RocksDB optimization, caching, etc. Hope we can achieve the effect of flying to M78 and obtaining help from Ultraman.

   * Project name: GraphYourCodeVulnerability
   * Project Introduction: Validation of GitHub projects exposure to CVE vulnerabilities

   * Project Briefing
      * Enable owner or user of the project hosted on GitHub to request validation of their exposure to CVE vulnerabilities.
Software will use info in repository about libraries and other referencing objects and collect information from other publicly available sources.
It will display graph of connected objects with their versions with detected vulnerabilities and exploits existing in the code.
In descriptions of CVE vulnerabilities visualized on graph, software will suggest to user to use patched versions of the libraries to improve security and avoid potential hacker attacks.

   * Project Background
       * Project will use Nebula Graph to enable graph traversals and pivoting of the source code objects to enable user to have 360 degree view of the project structure
with dependencies to libraries and connected repositories cross linked with CVE vulnerabilities. Nice feature will be support for full-text search to easy filter elements of the graph
and find objects of interest. Search will be enabled using Nebula integration with Elasticsearch engine and custom python parser and search primitives.

   * Project Value
       * Choosing existing code from other projects can include vulnerable code and libraries which are already exploited, that is especially true for relatively older code.
This project will enable user to validate exposure of the repository elements to known vulnerabilities and protect their own product and improve security of the software.

   * Project Design
       * Project will be developed in python and deployed as web application with Nebula Graph as backend database:
           - Custom python code for web application service
           - Nginx web server
           - Nebula Graph database integrated with Elasticsearch engine
           - Java Script visualization library

   * Project Testing
       * Project will be deployed on publicly available application server behind Nginx reverse proxy.
Data set will have already populated graph objects for most popular GitHub repositories, for more than 32000 repositories.
Users can select any of them and check vulnerability status of all components included in visually attractive graph representation supported with full-text search option.
For testing we will examine vulnerabilities for https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula
